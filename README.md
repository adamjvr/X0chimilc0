# X0chimilc0
Open source modular synthesizer and DSP platform

X0chimilc0 is designed to be a hardware extension of Axoloti, it intends to
use the same code base with extensions and backporting as many features as
possible to the flagship Axoloti board. The main idea behind X0chimilc0 is to
be nearly the same as Axoloti but with a more powerful MCU and addition of
an FPGA based hardware sequencer. X0chimilc0 is also focused at being a mother
board for custom hardware synthesizers. Read more about the Axoloti project
